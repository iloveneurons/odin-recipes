        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tonkotsu ramen is a noodle dish where the broth is made from pork bones. The broth is the heart and soul of the dish. Traditionally, the broth takes hours, or up to an entire day to make. But with an Instant Pot, that time drops. This recipe makes a creamy pork broth that serves as the perfect base to your tonkotsu ramen dish. Flavor the broth however you'd like, but this recipe suggests using soy sauce, miso, and a Japanese fish bouillon (in granules) called "dashi."</p>
