# odin-recipes
This is a basic recipe website with links to a few recipe pages. Each recipe page includes an image, a brief description, an ingredients list, and a list of directions. By completing this project, I practiced the following: writing the HTML boilerplate; navigating files and directories from the command line; making commits to Git; creating links, headings, paragraphs, and lists; inserting images using relative paths.
